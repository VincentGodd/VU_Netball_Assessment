### Are there differences in game profiles within the same overall position ?

```{r sheet 1}
# Activity Variables in a Dataframe filtered :
Activity_DF <- Df_Details %>% filter(Statistic == "minutesPlayed"| # Relative
                               Statistic == "disposals"| # Attaque +
                               Statistic == "badPasses"| # Attaque -
                               Statistic == "interceptPassThrown"| # Attaque -
                               Statistic == "deflections"| # Defense +
                               Statistic == "gain"| # Defense +
                               Statistic == "obstructionPenalties"|  
                               Statistic == "intercepts") # Defense +

# Pivot Table to observe the dependence between variable and choose the good one for this analysis :
Activity_DF <- Activity_DF %>% pivot_wider(names_from = Statistic, values_from = Total) %>% 
  group_by(Athlete,Poste_played) %>% 
  replace(is.na(.), 0) %>% 
  summarise(
    
            minutesPlayed = max(minutesPlayed),
            disposals = max(disposals),
            Bad_Disposal = sum(badPasses+interceptPassThrown),
            deflections = max(deflections),
            obstructionPenalties = max(obstructionPenalties),
            gain = max(gain),
            intercepts = max(intercepts),
            Gain_corrected = sum(deflections + intercepts),
          
            # e.g, you can have 2 disposal but 4 Bad, that's mean the calculation of disposal don't count bad tentative, so Full_Disposal :
            Full_Disposal = sum(Bad_Disposal+disposals), 
            Efficiency_Att = round((Full_Disposal - Bad_Disposal)/Full_Disposal,2),
            Full_Deff_Actions = sum(obstructionPenalties+Gain_corrected),
            Efficiency_Def = round((Full_Deff_Actions - obstructionPenalties)/Full_Deff_Actions,2)) %>% 
  
  mutate(Def_Act = round(Gain_corrected/minutesPlayed*4*15,1),
  Off_Act = round(disposals/minutesPlayed*4*15,1)) 

# We fixe a thresold of 3match for this analysis to have a more representative sample :
Activity_DF <- Activity_DF %>% filter(minutesPlayed>180)

# Profil - Comparaison demande poste en activities offensive et def :
library(scales) 
# Fonction Kmeans clustering :
library(stats) 

# because scale can't take df with non numeric variable, we have to create new df :
df <- data.frame(Activity_DF$Def_Act, Activity_DF$Off_Act) %>% scale()
kn3 <- kmeans(df, centers = 3, nstart = 25)
df2 <- data.frame( Athlete_Name = Activity_DF$Athlete,
                   Clusters =kn3$cluster,
                   Activity_Def = Activity_DF$Def_Act,
                   Activity_Off = Activity_DF$Off_Act,
                   Efficiency_Def = Activity_DF$Efficiency_Def,
                   Efficiency_Att = Activity_DF$Efficiency_Att)

# Plots :
p1 <- ggplot(data = df2, mapping = aes(x=Activity_DF$Def_Act,y=Activity_DF$Off_Act)) +
      geom_point(aes(color=Athlete_Name)) +
      geom_label(mapping = aes(label = Activity_DF$Athlete))+
      labs(y = "Offensive Activity (Actions per 60min = 1game)", x = "Defencive Activity (per 60min = 1game)") +
      labs(title = "Graph 1 : Offensive and Defensive Activity ")
ggplotly(p1)

```

*** 
## FIXTIVE STORY :

**We are looking for the best player available for our team. We need a central position player with main offensive qualities. Defensive qualities are secondary, as we already have one of the best defences in the league.**


### Clusters ?

```{r sheet2}

fviz_cluster(kn3, data = df,palette = "Set2", ggtheme = theme_minimal()) +
  labs(title = "Graph 2 : Athlete Clustering - Offensive and Defensive Activity ",
         subtitle = "Clustering by Kmeans",
         caption = "This Chart highligth 3 categories : Defencive domination, Offensive Domination and Mixt Profil.") # Title design

```

***


It is necessary to express the playing time data in order to make a relevant comparison.

**Activité Offencive**  : cumul of disposals season divided by minutes played.

**Activité Defencive** : cumul gains (defections + interceps) divided by minutes played.




This graph classifies the different athletes into three distinct clusters using the Kmeans method. The data appears to be grouped as "mixed activity", "attack dominated activity", "defense dominated activity"


### profitability of the player in attack ?

```{r sheet3}

df3 <- df2 %>% group_by(Clusters) %>%  mutate(top3_thresold = ifelse(rank(-Activity_Off)<=3,"TRUE","FALSE"))

library(ggrepel)
P2 <- ggplot(data = df3, mapping = aes(x = Efficiency_Att, y = Activity_Off)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Clusters)) +
  facet_wrap(. ~ Clusters,scales = "free")+
  geom_label_repel(aes(label = ifelse(top3_thresold, as.character(Athlete_Name),"")))+
  labs(title = "Graph 3 : Offensive Analysis - Efficiency vs Acticity ",
         subtitle = "Find the best player per profil, which player is working most efficiently ?",
         caption = "Performance is a balance between work and efficiency !")
P2

```

***



**Profitability** is the balance between the amount of work the player does and his efficiency. Having a player with a lot of game action but little efficiency is not interesting for us. Similarly, if a player is very efficient but does not do much in the game, then he does not affect the dynamics of the game.



TOP 3: Price, Nankivell and Jovic, are the best performing players in the Kmean category "Mixed activity",

**TOP 3**: Garbin, Fowler and Wallace, are the best performing players in the Kmean category **"Attacking dominance activity"**,

TOP 3: Mannix, Delaney and Sterling, are the best performing players in the Kmean category "Defending dominance activity".

**Finally, for our team, the most relevant choices seem : Garbin, Fowler and Wallace!**


### And about defense ?

```{r sheet4}

df4 <- df3 %>% filter(Athlete_Name =="Garbin, S"|
                      Athlete_Name =="Fowler, J"|
                      Athlete_Name =="Wallace, S")

P3 <- ggplot(data = df4, mapping = aes(x = Efficiency_Def, y = Activity_Def)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = Athlete_Name)) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d()+
  labs(title = "Graph 4 : TOP 3 players in Attack ",
         subtitle = "which one are the best defender ?",
         caption = " WE HAVE TO CALL Garbin,S!")
P3

```

***
This graph shows the profitability of the top 3 players isolated as mentioned above. This allows us to determine which player has done the most work efficiently balance. In this case, we focused on the **defensive activity**.

📢 WE WANT GARBIN,S !!!!

This player fits our needs best. In addition to his offensive activity of 62 actions per game with an efficiency of 95%. He also knows how to be efficient in a defensive system with 3 actions per game, 93% efficiency 💪🏽.
